## Project intro 
The research intends to develop an AI-powered model for forecasting loan application outcomes, an important step for financial institutions trying to increase operational efficiency. The use of machine learning techniques will assist in automating decision-making in loan approvals, minimizing the need for manual reviews and potentially increasing the accuracy and speed of loan distribution. The approach is consistent with the rising trend in the financial sector of utilizing new technologies to simplify difficult operations, therefore the implementation of such predictive models stands as a pivotal innovation.

By analyzing the methods by which machine learning models process and interpret incoming data to create predictions, we want to design an effective solution while contributing to the academic and practical knowledge bases.
